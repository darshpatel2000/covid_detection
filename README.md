# covid_detection

This repository provides the foundational work for detecting covids using x-rays.

The goal is to determine whether the patient has pneunomonia or covid-19 based on x-ray scans, or if the patient is entirely normal.

I collected x-ray photos containing covid-19 from the first link; label information was taken from metadata.csv, and images were saved in the images folder.

I gathered x-ray images of pneunomonia and normal x-ray images from the second link.
